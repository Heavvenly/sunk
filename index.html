    <p class="frankenstein">In Frankenstein, Mary Shelley uses <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> to amplify the theme of accursedness after disrupting nature while contrasting how they learn from their mistakes to heighten Frankenstein’s
      tragedy.</p> <br>  <br>
    <p class="frankenstein">Notes: All ellipses(...) have been replaced with two spaces for clarity, and most lines of Frankenstein have been listed in the docs version history, with The Rime of the Ancient Mariner quotes being from their respective parts, all lines in Times New Roman are from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and all lines in Spectral are from Frankenstein</p>
